# imod - Independent Modules

    imod is a project aiming to provide developpers with a range of modules to
    build software on laptops/desktops. Modules include:

        > imod-gp: "imod-graphics" for creating windows and graphics context
            and providing an abstraction on keyboard and mouse.
        > imod-ad: "imod-audio" for abstracting usage of OSS
        > imod-in: "imod-input" for controller support
        > imod-mt: "imod-math" to extend math with Matrices, Vectors, etc.
        > imot-nt: "imod-net" abstraction layer for networking used in multiplayer

    Every functions available to developpers will start with imod[NameOfModule].
    For instance:
        imodGP_CreateWindow(...)
        imodAD_InitializeSound(...)
        imodIN_FindController(...)
        imodMT_CreateMatrix(...)
        imodNT_AddMultiplayer(...) # if only it was that simple


    Each module's include folder has the following directories: public, private, 
    reserved.
        
        > public: available to the developpers (strat with imodGP, imodAD, etc)
        > private: available only to the module (end with imodGP, imodAD, etc)
        > reserved: available to a module section only (components do not possess the module pre/postfix)


    Imod aims to be compatible with the following operating ranging from most prioritiezed to least
    from top to bottom:
        > FreeBSD
        > OpenBSD
        > NetBSD
