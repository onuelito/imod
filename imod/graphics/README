#imodGP - Graphics Module

    Module used to create window instances on X11 or Wayland. After the creation of
    the instances a graphics context will be attached to the window. The context
    will be either with OpenGL ES3 or Vulkan.


    # Pre configuration

        Before building imodGP, developper will be required to run the "setup.lua"
        file that will create a header file named specs.h. This header file will
        be used by source files throught macros to exclude code portions.

    # Build requirements
        > Wayland or X11
        > Lua 5.3+ (older versions might be compatible)
        > OpenGL ES3 or Vulkan
